Setup:
======

1. Run `gem install bundler && bundle install`
2. cd to a selenium checkout
3. Use `bin/vagrant-go` to execute crazyfun targets.

This will be pretty slow for the time being since we set up the full VM from scratch on every command.

TODO 
====

-	use vagrant-snap to do snapshots/rollback.
